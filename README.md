<img src="https://github.com/vn33/Next-word-Predictor-LSTM/blob/master/output.png">

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple next word predictor using a trained LSTM model. The model predicts the next word in a sentence based on the input provided by the user. The model has been trained on a dataset of customer support interactions related to GitHub Copilot.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Keras
- ipywidgets (for GUI version)
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (for running the code)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install the required dependencies using pip

## Usage
1. Train the model: Run the provided Jupyter Notebook (`next_word_lstm_project.ipynb`) or Google Colab notebook to train the LSTM model using your dataset.
2. Enter a sentence and see the predicted next word.

## Dataset
The model has been trained on a dataset of customer support interactions related to GitHub Copilot. The dataset contains a collection of questions and responses from GitHub Copilot users, covering various topics and issues encountered during usage.
